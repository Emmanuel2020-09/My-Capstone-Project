# My-Capstone-Project - Amazon Product Review Analysis
This is my first hands-on project in my data analysis journey. This project was completed as part of my role as a Junior Analyst with RetailTech Insight. The deliverables include an Excel dashboard. 
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 
a) Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
b) Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 

Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values. 
Total Records: 1,465 
Total Fields: 16 columns
Pivot tables and calculated columns were created where necessary to answer these questions:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price Ã— rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <â‚¹200, â‚¹200â€“â‚¹500, >â‚¹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined
